# Solution

This is an OSINT question that involves multiple steps - they stem from the various hints scattered throughout the question.  

The first hint is the Copyright symbol - the fact that this might contain a clue is supported by the strange output of `exiftool`, as detailed in this capture.

`T2xnaWVyZCBQYXF1aXRv`, when decoded from Base64, becomes `Olgierd Paquito`. This hilarious username houses a Twitter (`X`, inferred from the question) account with the same name.  

On browsing through the (numerous, sometimes demotivating) tweets, we stumble across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/OlgierdPaquito/status/1697542289932058768), which contains the following clue.

```
Btw, there is a tool used to search for accounts on social media. The password might be related to his close friend's surname.
```

A cursory Google Search for this tool leads us to a possible match - [Sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock). This leads to the password - `Watson` which unlocks the password-protected file and hence the flag.
