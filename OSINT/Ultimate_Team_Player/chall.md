## Challenge Question

I was offered a Â£1 Million offer from Liverpool as a teen from Cheshire; and have the honour of being a bronze player in Yeet's favourite game (the soundtrack of which contains this absolute [banger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahc8ZsbP24Q).

I can't find my brother and am going to look for him now. He messaged me saying that he's done playing an important game, what road do I put in my GPS system?
