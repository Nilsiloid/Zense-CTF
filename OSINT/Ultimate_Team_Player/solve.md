# Solution

This challenge is admittedly one of the more niche challenges in this contest. Through the link to the song in the question, we can deduce that the game in question is FIFA 12. Now, we must look at databases of FIFA 12 Ultimate team players (we choose to survey UT players through the name of the question.)

After this, we must filter through the British 18-year-olds (at the time) players and dig up reports about them to validate the offer. The search concludes with Max Clayton [ref]. (https://www.futwiz.com/en/fifa12/players?minrating=40&maxrating=99&age[]=18&age[]=18)

After we zone in on [Max Clayton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Clayton), we can discover that his brother plays for [Nantwich Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantwich_Town_F.C.) - hinting to his whereabouts after the end of a game. Putting the coordinates of Nantwich town's stadium leads us to the road leading to it - Reaseheath Way. This leads to our flag!!

The flag is:

```
ZENSE{reaseheathway}
```
